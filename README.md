## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first

### What I learned


I reinforced my HTML and CSS knowledge in:  
_**attributes:**_ `role` and `arial-label`

property: `position: relative;` and `display: none;`

---
```html
<div class="left-img" role="img" aria-label="image containing six small, round photos, with faces of 2 women and 4 men">
</div>
```

```css
.left-img{
  background-image: url("../assets/desktop/image-hero-left.png");
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  position: relative;
  left: -33px;
  top: -45px;
  width: 28%;
  height: 55%;
  min-height: 303px;
}
```

```css
    .right-img {
  display: none;
}
```


### Continued development

I will dedicate myself to future projects using javascript concepts along with html and css which I am studying and improving myself
